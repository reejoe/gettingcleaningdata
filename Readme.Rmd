# Getting and Cleaning Data: Course Project

## Introduction

This repository contains my work for the course project for the Coursera course
"Getting and Cleaning data", part of the Data Science specialization.

## Source Code

run_analysis.R is a script to merge the training and test data and produce the
tiny data set

## Prerequisite

and save them in the dir ~/R/courseproj 
where '~' is your home DIR defined in R

## Running the script
Save the script in a directory and set that directory as your working dir

## Execution

in your working directory
